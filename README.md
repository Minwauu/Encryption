# Encryption

## Symmetric and asymmetric encryption

- Encryption is the process of encoding a message so that it can be read only by the sender and the intended recipient.
- Caesar cipher - shift of spaces = key.

## Reeves questions answers
 - The key must be sent across a network and is vulnerable to interception
 - A will have a private key known only to A, A will also have a public key, which is mathematically realted to the private key. It is called a public key as anyone can access it. B will also have a private key and a related public key. For A to send a secure message to B, A will first encrypt the message using B's public key. As the private and public keys are related, the message can only be decrypted by using B's private key.As no-one else knows B's private key, even if the message is intercepted, it could not be decrypted.
 - The message being sent has a publicly known hashing algorithm applied to it to create what is known as a hash. The hashing algorithm changes the original data, for example by carrying out modulo arithmetic on the binary equivalents of the original data. 
- A firewall is a method of preventing data from entering onto your computer or LAn from an external computer, you can use two network cards - one that sends and receives data from the external connection and one that sends and receives data from the LAN. Software can be used to examine the contents
- Firewall, proxy server, physical security - e.g locked room, usernames and passwords
- install virus protection software, regularly update virus protection software, remove your computer from external networks.
